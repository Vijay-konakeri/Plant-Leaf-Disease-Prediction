# Plant Leaf Disease Detection and Classification

This project aims to develop an intelligent system for accurate detection and classification of plant leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. With the ever-increasing need for efficient crop management and yield improvement, early and precise disease diagnosis is crucial in the agricultural domain.

## Overview

The project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and TensorFlow to build a robust model capable of classifying plant leaf diseases from image data. The system is designed to streamline the disease identification process, providing farmers and agricultural experts with a reliable tool for timely intervention and appropriate remedial measures.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Implementing advanced image processing techniques, including segmentation and feature extraction, to enhance the input leaf images and isolate the affected regions.
- **CNN Model Development**: Training and optimizing a CNN model on a large dataset of leaf images across multiple disease classes, achieving high accuracy in disease classification.
- **Web Application Deployment**: Integrating the trained model into a user-friendly web application using Flask, allowing users to upload leaf images and receive disease predictions along with suggested remedies.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Developing an interactive and visually appealing front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless image upload and visualization of results.

## Technologies Used
